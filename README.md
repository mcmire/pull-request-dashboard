# METAPHOR

METAPHOR is a library that you can use to display a timeline of events.

It is modeled after the Timeline module in SIMILE,
an great opensource project which was developed in 2006 by MIT
but is now unfortunately abandoned.

This repo is currently a proof of concept and includes not only the library being developed,
but also a demo of its functionality.
